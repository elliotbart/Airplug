# Configuration file for layer 2 Makefile.
#  - distributed in the skeleton distribution (the nest)
#  - not distributed in the binary distribution (or as binary package)
#    (Application that does not require compilation)
# This file is NOT standard: specific for LIBAPGTK (LIB and SOURCES variables)


### APPLICATION DEPENDENT VARIABLES ############################################

#-- TCLTK APPLICATION COMPONENTS ----------------------------------------------#
# NB: adding a new module or a new file to the application does not require
#     to adapt the variables values below providing the file has been named
#     according to the rule: nameoftheapplication-nameofthemodule.tk

# RC is either empty or equal to rc-$(OUTPUT).py if it exists
RC = $(shell if [ -e rc-$(OUTPUT).py ] ; then echo rc-$(OUTPUT).py ; else echo "" ; fi )

## LIB is either empty or equal to libapg-app-$(OUTPUT).tk if it exists
## LIB = $(shell if [ -e libapg-app-$(OUTPUT).tk ] ; then echo libapg-app-$(OUTPUT).tk ; else echo "" ; fi )

# LIB contains all files libapg-xxx.tk which are not symbolic links.
LIB = $(shell find  libapg-???.py -type f )

# NB:
# - Common libraries are currently libapg-int.tk libapg-eve.tk libapg-svg.tk
#   libapg-msg.tk libapg-com.tk libapg-sta.tk
# - Term mode libraries are libapg-snd.tk libapg-rcv.tk libapg-sub.tk
# - Emu mode libraries are Term mode libraries + libapg-emu.tk (provided by
#   EMU, ie. symbolic link)
# - Live mode libraries are Term mode libraries (except sub) + libapg-apg.tk
#   (provided by APG, ie. symbolic link)

# SOURCES stands for all sources files belonging to the application
# NB : wildcard does the immediat expansion.
# SOURCES = $(wildcard $(OUTPUT)*.tk) $(RC) $(LIB) 
SOURCES = libapg.py $(RC) $(LIB)

# NB: no OUTPUT.


#-- FILES FOR APPLICATION PACKAGING--------------------------------------------#

# List of all files for the public archive
# NB: any file in the bin/doc/icons or input subdirectory of the application
#     will be installed (with symlink) in the bin/doc/icons or input/$(OUTPUT)
#     of the distribution.
# NB: if one of these subdirectories is listed here while they do not exist,
#     it is ignored silently.
# NB: Be aware to add directory_name/* (such as bin/*) and not directory_name
#     nor directory_name/
