# Configuration file for layer 3 generic Makefile.
# This file is standard for all applications
#  - not distributed in the skeleton distribution (the nest)
#  - not distributed in the binary distribution (or as binary package)
#    (Application that does not require compilation)


### APPLICATION DEPENDENT VARIABLES ############################################

#-- TCLTK APPLICATION COMPONENTS ----------------------------------------------#
# NB: adding a new module or a new file to the application does not require
#     to adapt the variables values below providing the file has been named
#     according to the rule: nameoftheapplication-nameofthemodule.tk

# RC is either empty or equal to rc-$(OUTPUT).tk if it exists
RC = $(shell if [ -e rc-$(OUTPUT).tk ] ; then echo rc-$(OUTPUT).tk ; else echo "" ; fi )

# LIB is either empty or equal to libapg-app-$(OUTPUT).tk if it exists
#LIB = $(shell if [ -e libapg-app-$(OUTPUT)*.tk ] ; then echo libapg-app-$(OUTPUT)*.tk ; else echo "" ; fi )
LIB = $(shell echo libapg-app-$(OUTPUT)*.tk )

# SOURCES stands for all sources files belonging to the application
# NB : wildcard does the immediat expansion.
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(OUTPUT)*.tk) $(RC) $(LIB) 


#-- FILES FOR APPLICATION PACKAGING--------------------------------------------#

# List of all files for the public archive
# NB: any file in the bin, doc, icons or input subdirectory of the application
#     will be installed (with symlink) in the bin, doc, icons or input/$(OUTPUT)
#     of the distribution.
# NB: if one of these subdirectories is listed here while they do not exist,
#     a warning is generated.
# NB: Be aware to add 'directory_name/*' (such as bin/*) and not
#     'directory_name' nor 'directory_name/' (without '/*' as suffix)
